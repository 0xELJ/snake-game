# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
3. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without running into the obstacles or your own tail.

## Future Improvements

- Add a start screen and an end screen.
- Keep track of the high score using local storage.
- Add different levels of difficulty (e.g., increase the speed of the snake as it gets longer).
